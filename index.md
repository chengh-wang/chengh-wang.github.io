I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at Northeastern University under the supervision of Prof. Alireza Ramezani. My research interests lie at the intersection of optimal control, deep learning, locomotion, and hardware. My long-term goal is to investigate action, perception, and learning as an integrated loop, developing agile, robust controls for polyarticular mechanisms thus achieve human-level athletic intelligence.
